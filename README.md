# Trans_Knowledge

Welcome to this repository!

This repo contains a collection of multiple discrete and serialized works
surronding the same topic: address the deep mechanism of knowledge making progress with computational
method.

This repo may be less organized, for I accidentally broke my computer this spring
and I still gathering discrete documents and getting things organized.

My final project for the course Computational Content Analysis is under the Final Project
directory. Within this directory, there are four files. CTD_demo is what I used to
convert chemical names in their smiles format. As the library is not really reliable,
this code is written in a recursive way (which means I need to run it recursively).
The Smile&Abs_Embedding is where I do all the embedding works, structural, functional, and semantic.
I also did validation of the embedding in this script.
The Pubmed_para script is used for connecting the CTD dataset to PubMed publication
dataset.
And the Dual_EDA is the punchline here. This is the notebook where I basically do all
the analysis, visualization, and exploration. Well, I have to say,
a lot more of interesting results and findings failed to find their
place in the final essay, because I am simply too exhausted to address and 
articulate on them.

What's more, the Pubmed_para and the Smiles&Abs_Embedding are written
for the colab.
